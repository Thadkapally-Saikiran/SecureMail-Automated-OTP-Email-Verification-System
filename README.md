# SecureMail: Automated OTP Email Verification System

## Overview

SecureMail is a Python-based email verification system designed to streamline user authentication processes by employing automated OTP (One-Time Password) delivery and validation. This project combines simplicity and security, making it ideal for applications requiring an additional layer of user verification. 🔐✉️

## Features

### 🔒 Secure Email Automation
- **Tech Stack**: Python, SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), smtplib
- Implements an automated email delivery system using the SMTP protocol.
- Secures email transmission with TLS encryption to ensure privacy and safety.
- Encrypted login credentials for enhanced protection against unauthorized access.

### 🔑 OTP Verification Mechanism
- Dynamically generates a 6-digit OTP using randomized algorithms.
- Built with Python’s `random` and `math` modules to create unique and robust OTPs.
- Ensures precise user input validation, preventing brute force and manual bypass attempts.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍
- **Core Libraries**: smtplib, random, math
- **Security Protocols**: TLS encryption
- **Authentication Techniques**: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

## How It Works ⚙️

1. **User Triggers Verification**: The user enters their email address into the system.
2. **OTP Generation**: A 6-digit OTP is generated using a secure randomization algorithm.
3. **Email Delivery**: The OTP is sent to the user’s email using Python’s `smtplib` library.
4. **Validation**: The user enters the OTP received in their email for verification.
5. **Authentication**: The system validates the OTP input to confirm user authenticity.
